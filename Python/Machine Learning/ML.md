## Machine Learning

### Data Types
#### 1.Numerical
#####   Discrete Data
-   numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
    <br />
#####   Continuous Data
-   numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
#### 2.Categorical
    data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.
#### 3.Ordinal
    data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.

### Mean, Median, and Mode
#### 1.Mean
    The mean value is the average value.

    To calculate the mean, find the sum of all values, and divide the sum by the number of values:

    (99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77
#### 1.Median
    The median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values:

    77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 88, 94, 99, 103, 111
#### 1.Mode
    The Mode value is the value that appears the most number of times:

    99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86 = 86

### Standard Deviation
    Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

    A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.

    A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

    Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:

    speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]

    The standard deviation is:

    0.9

    Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean value, which is 86.4.
