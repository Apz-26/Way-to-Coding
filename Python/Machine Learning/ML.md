### Data Types
#### Numerical
Discrete Data
- numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
    <br />
Continuous Data
- numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
#### Categorical

#### Ordinal
data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
