## Machine Learning

### Data Types
#### 1.Numerical
#####   Discrete Data
-   numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
    <br />
#####   Continuous Data
-   numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
#### 2.Categorical
    data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.
#### 3.Ordinal
    data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.

### Mean, Median, and Mode
#### 1.Mean
    The mean value is the average value.

    To calculate the mean, find the sum of all values, and divide the sum by the number of values:

    (99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77
